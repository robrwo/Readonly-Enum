=head1 NAME

Readonly::Enum - enumerated scalar values

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Readonly::Enum;

  # $foo = 1, $bar = 2, etc.

  Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz); 

  # $foo = 0, $bar = 1, etc.

  Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz) => 0; 

  # $foo = 0, $bar = 5, $baz = 6, etc.

  Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz) => (0, 5); 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides some syntactic sugar for defining enumerated
scalar values.

It is to L<Readonly> what the L<enum> package is to L<constant>.
Unlike enumerated constants, these scalars can be used as hash keys
and interpolated in strings.

Unlike L<enum>, only integers are supported in this version.
