NAME
    Readonly::Enum - enumerated scalar values

SYNOPSIS
      use Readonly::Enum;

      # $foo = 1, $bar = 2, etc.

      Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz); 

      # $foo = 0, $bar = 1, etc.

      Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz) => 0; 

      # $foo = 0, $bar = 5, $baz = 6, etc.

      Readonly::Enum my ($foo, $bar, $baz) => (0, 5); 

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides some syntactic sugar for defining enumerated scalar
    values.

    It is to Readonly what the enum package is to constant. Unlike
    enumerated constants, these scalars can be used as hash keys and
    interpolated in strings.

    Unlike enum, only integers are supported in this version.
